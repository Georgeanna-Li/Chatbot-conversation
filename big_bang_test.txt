Xinyi the User says: Can you give me another hint about favorite episodes
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: 
I certainly can. The next episodes are, 
I like it when Raj and Lucy text date
I like it when Bert talks to Penny
The Justice League One

Xinyi the User says: I like it when Raj and Lucy text date
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: At the library, so her shyness won’t be as obvious, and since he can’t speak to women, he can text back and forth with her. Lucy asks him, I don’t know, do you visit a lot of porn websites?

Xinyi the User says: Prom websites
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: Sorry, autocorrect. And then Raj gushes over actually visiting prom websites, and HE says 

Xinyi the User says: sorry, autocorrect
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: I like sports. Which Lucy accepts without comment, as she obviously knows this is not a sports kind of guy. But they do play sports on the show, real and virtual. (This leads the user to ask, What sports do they play?)

Xinyi the User says: Can you give me a hint about when Raj and Lucy text date
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: It went like so. Prom websites, sorry autocorrect

Xinyi the User says: Can you give me a hint about when Bert talks to Penny
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: If you steal my idol, 6 tons of granite and micacious schist, I will roll right over you, I like Thor and Doctor Jones, One plays with lightning

Xinyi the User says: I like it when Bert talks to Penny
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: When Penny attends Bert’s party, and no one comes but her. Would you like 20 pounds of chip dip? That is so precious. Still, Bert has his triumphs. Like when he wins that award, and when he joins the band, he helps them by singing his own signature song

Xinyi the User says: If you steal my idol
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: I will roll right over you. Cause I’m

Xinyi the User says: 6 tons of granite and micacious schist
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: But if you steal my idol

Xinyi the User says: I will roll right over you
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: Fantastic. There have been some good songs on the show, and some bad songs, like Thor and Doctor Jones

Xinyi the User says: I like Thor and Doctor Jones
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: One plays with idols, the other plays with bones. 

Xinyi the User says: One plays with lightning
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: Right, because it’s Thor. Lightning. Do you like Raj’s Scavenger hunt? How about The Justice League One?

Xinyi the User says: The Justice League one
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: They were in the comic book store and Stuart announces there is going to be a contest

Xinyi the User says: A costume contest
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: So Sheldon is hinting that they could get a better Superman. Leonard is horrified.

Xinyi the User says: I’m Superman
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: With lifts in my boots, I’ll be taller this year. So they start showing up in costume, and they have really good costumes. Who is the Flash?

Xinyi the User says: Sheldon is the Flash
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: He has the build of a runner, too. He actually looks good in costume, but he doesn’t have a Flash personality, it’s the same old Sheldon. He’s jogging in place back and forth. What are you doing?

Xinyi the User says: I’m pacing
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: The Flash paces at super speed. Wait, who is Aquaman? 

Xinyi the User says: Raj is Aquaman
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: I don’t want to be Aqua man

Xinyi the User says: Aquaman sucks under water
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: Raj comes in wearing this ridiculous costume, riding a children’s sea horse. Who is Green Lantern?

Xinyi the User says: Leonard is Green Lantern
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: Leonard makes a good Green Lantern. He not anywhere near as good looking as you, but he looks all right in the costume.  Except you never see Green Lantern wearing these

Xinyi the User says: Glasses
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: A nearsighted Green Lantern! Who is Batman, then?

Xinyi the User says: Howard is Batman
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: Howard performing the manly pose and the tough Batman voice is hilarious. But who is Penny?

Xinyi the User says: Penny is Wonder Woman
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: Except she doesn’t like the wig, for some reason. Zack starts making it worse. Didn’t Leonard save the day, and go talk to Penny about Wonder Woman?

Xinyi the User says: I like it when Leonard talks to Penny about Wonder Woman
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: He listens to her, which not a lot of her boyfriends do, and she finally agreed. Leonard was pretty confident they were going to win

Xinyi the User says: We have an actual girl
Esmerelda Quest Bot Says: Playing Wonder Woman, no less. Anyway, they won. This is changing the subject, but how about the time Amy gets a crush on Zack?
